This is my Portfolio Website

Showcasing Skills and Achievements: A portfolio website serves as a platform to showcase your skills, expertise, projects, and achievements. It provides a comprehensive view of my capabilities to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. A well-designed portfolio website helps in establishing a strong professional brand identity. Unlike traditional resumes or CVs, a portfolio website offers more flexibility for personalization and creativity. You can customize the design, layout, and content to reflect your personality, style, and unique strengths.
1.	HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure and content of the web page, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and sections.
2.	CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used for styling and formatting the HTML elements. It allows you to control the layout, appearance, and design of the web page, including aspects such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
3.	JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. In this code, JavaScript is not explicitly used, but it's a fundamental technology for creating more interactive and dynamic elements on a web page, such as form validation, animations, and event handling.
